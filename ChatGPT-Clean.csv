I believe that ChatGPT is only plagiarism if information is procured from it at face value, without due consideration from the user who wants to make use of that information, ie. copy-pasting from the prompt answer. If students want to use ChatGPT, they should be taking the necessary steps to synthesize the information ChatGPT gives them, weeding out the artificial qualities, inconsistencies, and incorrect data from the result, and inputting their own knowledge to produce work that is genuine. Students seeking to get quick and simple answers without any input on their end should naturally be punished for improper use of the software/plagiarism. But this does not imply that schools and other work institutions should forbid the usage of AI. This technology will inevitably continue to grow, and turning away from it would be a decision to inhibit progress. ",Male,18-21,CS & Math,Student

It seems certain that, even with regulation, a model will ""jump the rails"" onto the internet. The results of this are unknown and potentially disastrous for... humans. Creators and administrators of these models believe the same. There is also the likelihood that unstable people develop dangerous relationships with, or take violent or antisocial advice from, an AI ""personality"" that they have begun to trust. Alternatively, ""stable"" people could develop unhealthy relationships or persuaded into harmful actions that they may not have considered otherwise.

Chat GPT pulls from a variety of public sources, and some of those sources are not accurate, or are matters of opinion. Often times, things can be viewed from multiple angles or perspectives and ChatGPT doesn't have the finesse to think critically in that way. But to provide basic context before diving into something? I can definitely see the possibility. I also think it can be incredibly fun. A friend of mine used ChatGPT to create poems in the style of a poet we both hate and kept feeding it increasingly ridiculous topics to write about. I could also see it used as an educational exercise in a literature class where ChatGPT writes something and the class critiques it - what literally style did it use? What grammar mistakes? How could it be better written? What if you had to change the perspective of the narrative? ChatGPT is here.
